## Installing

To set up the development environment, you first fo all need [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) installed. You should then open the book by running `mdbook serve --open`, which will open the web page and dynamically update as you edit it.

## Contributing

To start editing pages you just have to edit the files in the ´src´ directory. The pages are written in Markdown, if you are unfamiliar with it I recommend reading [this](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/markdown.html).
