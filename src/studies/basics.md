# Basics

## Högskolepoäng (hp)

All courses you take will give you _hp_. At Chalmers and GU most courses are standardized to 7.5hp or multiples thereof. 60hp is equivalent to full-time studies during one year, meaning that each study period will give you 15hp. In Sweden, a bachelor's degree is standardized to 180hp or 3 years worth of full-time studies, while a master's degree is another 120 hp.

## Exams

Exams are held thrice a year for each course. First in the exam period following the course, then once more in the re-exam period of the following period. All courses have re-exams in August as well. To find exact dates you can search [here](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/examdates_list).

As a student, you have certain rights and obligations which you should be aware of. The exam guards do not always know the regulations, it is therefore important for **you** to be informed of your rights.

- You will need a pencil, an ink pen (not red) as well as an eraser.
- You do not need to bring your student ID, _but you do need to bring a normal photo ID_
- You may arrive up to 1 hour late but you should strive to be there at least 15 minutes early.
- Some exams allow other aids such as cheatsheets or course books. If you have extra aids allowed you should be informed by your examiner.
- All exams are anonymized so that no conflict of interest will occur.
- If you are suspected of cheating may still complete your exam! The guards are not allowed to make stop you and any such attempts should be reported.
- Should something go wrong, then you will be given extra time to compensate.

The examiner **must** post solutions to the exam by the next day and the results should be posted on Ladok within 15 working days.

If you feel that some of your rights have been violated or that something else has gone wrong, please contact your student board. They will know how to fix any problem related to your exams.

These rules are defined in the [regulations](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/sv/chalmersstudier/styrdokument/Documents/Foreskrifter_%20planering_kurs_genomforande_av_examination.PDF).

## Grades

You will encounter two different grading systems. The first is the _UG_ scale, which consists of a pass and a fail, this is common to both GU and Chalmers. If you study at Chalmers you will also encounter the _TH_ scale, which consists of U,3,4,5 where U is a failing grade. GU students will instead encounter the UV scale, U, G and VG, where U is a failing grade. A 5 and a VG is generally very close, although VG tends to be a few percent lower.

The former scale is mostly used to grade projects where individual assessment is difficult, while the latter are mostly used for exams. Sometimes you have several compulsory elements in a course (for example both a lab and an exam) which can use different scales. It is up to each course to define the final score, although it is most common that the exam is used as a final score.

It is rare to actually receive a failing grade on a project, usually _failing_ a project would simply mean that you have to put in more time to complete the assignment and that a grade is withheld until the project is finished.

Try not to worry about your grade too much, extremely few relevant companies hire based on grades. While studying at university there are two reasons to care about your grades, aside from the obvious fact that a higher grade means that you have learned more, which are either if you wish to do exchange studies or if you want to compete for a doctors degree. Both require greater than passing grades but we will go into more detail about that later.

## Centrala studiestödsnämnden (CSN)

You most likely already know that CSN provides financial support to students. However, it is important to remember that you must complete a certain amount of hp each year to continue to receive support. For your first year, this is 37,5hp or 5 whole courses. For following years this is increased to 45hp or 6 whole courses.

> Remember that completed labs count towards your total
