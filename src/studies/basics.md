# Basics

## Högskolepoäng (hp)

All courses you take will give you _hp_. At Chalmers and GU most courses are standardized to 7.5hp or multiples thereof. 60hp is equivalent to full-time studies during one year, meaning that each study period will give you 15hp. In Sweden, a bachelor's degree is standardized to 180hp or 3 years worth of full-time studies, while a master's degree is another 120 hp.

## Grades

You will encounter two different grading systems. The first is the _UG_ scale, which consists of a pass and a fail, this is common to both GU and Chalmers. If you study at Chalmers you will also encounter the _TH_ scale, which consists of U,3,4,5 where U is a failing grade. GU students will instead encounter the UV scale, U, G and VG, where U is a failing grade. A 5 and a VG is generally very close, although VG tends to be a few percent lower.

The former scale is mostly used to grade projects where individual assessment is difficult, while the latter are mostly used for exams. Sometimes you have several compulsory elements in a course (for example both a lab and an exam) which can use different scales. It is up to each course to define the final score, although it is most common that the exam is used as a final score.

It is rare to actually receive a failing grade on a project, usually _failing_ a project would simply mean that you have to put in more time to complete the assignment and that a grade is withheld until the project is finished.

Try not to worry about your grade too much, extremely few relevant companies hire based on grades. While studying at university there are two reasons to care about your grades, aside from the obvious fact that a higher grade means that you have learned more, which are either if you wish to do exchange studies or if you want to compete for a doctors degree. Both require greater than passing grades but we will go into more detail about that later.

> Students at Chalmers who pass all their courses during their first year (including re-exams) are eligible for [_Adlerbertska stiftelsens stipendie_](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/sv/studentliv/stipendier/Sidor/Adlerbertska-stiftelserna.aspx).

## Centrala studiestödsnämnden (CSN)

You most likely already know that CSN provides financial support to students. However, it is important to remember that you must complete a certain amount of hp each year to continue to receive support. For your first year, this is 37,5hp or 5 whole courses. For following years this is increased to 45hp or 6 whole courses.

> Remember that completed labs count towards your total
