# Your education

While you are enrolled in a specific programme with certain mandatory courses and so on there remains much room for shaping your own education. The actual details vary depending on programme but this chapter will describe common scenarios and when it is time to make decisions. This chapter tries to remain neutral as to which choices you should make. You will however find testimonials and comparisons from both satisfied and unsatisfied students.
