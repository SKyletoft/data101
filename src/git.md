# Git - Version Control
*A must-have tool for every computer engineer, developer, or really anyone who writes text documents regularly.*

Git is a set of tools that help you get track of the changes you make to your text files. Git helps you collaborate with others by keeping track of who did what, as well as guiding you in merging your different versions of files. Git lets you be fearless when changing your code, safe in the knowledge that previous versions of your code are easy to access.

Git is something one will have to use during the program. In project courses, the bachelor's and master's theses it is almost always a requirement. And in nearly every course you will have assignments where collaboration will be far easier if you and your lab partner know and use Git. In addition to this, Git is one of the most used tools in the industry. A true industry standard, you will not find a job after the D-program which doesn't require it!

In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up the necessary software and accounts for a modern Git experience. We will introduce you to the basic concepts of version control. Finally we will show a basic workflow for collaboration with Git in the typical programming assignments you will encounter in the program.

We do not assume that you are comfortable in the terminal, and will strongly advise using the GUI-based program GitKraken to handle your git needs. This is an excellent tool, that helps pedagogically visualize the version control concepts. Do note that most users of Git do use the terminal commands. If you are comfortable in the terminal or would prefer to learn that way right away, look no further than this tutorial: [TODO terminalbaserad git tutorial](https://www.google.se)
## Setup

Install Git

Create an account on GitHub

GitHub Student

Install GitKraken

Login with GitHub

Generate SSH-Key, add to GitHub account

Install GitLens for VSCode

## The Basics

Creating a repository,

Working Directory, Index, and HEAD

Git add, git commit

Adding a remote, cloning a repository

push and pull

## A Workflow for regular Lab Assignments
*Sometimes it is easier just to commit to the main branch*

## Branching and merging
*For when you want to go your own way a little while.*

The Main (formerly known as the master) branch.

Creating a new branch

Merging with another branch

Rebasing, for when you wish you would have branched out later

Solving conflicts

## A workflow for group projects
*Branches help more, the more people that are collaborating.*
