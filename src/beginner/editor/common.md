## Creating a file

Let's start with creating a file. This is done using !kbd[!ctrl+N]. You can then save the file using !kbd[!ctrl+S].

## Moving the caret

To move the caret, use the arrow keys. You can also move to the start or end of the line by pressing !kbd[Home] or !kbd[End] respectively. To move a whole word, hold !kbd[!ctrl] while pressing !kbd[Left arrow] or !kbd[Right arrow].

## Selecting text

You may be used to selecting text by either holding in left-click and dragging or double-clicking on a word. This works in VSCode as well but can be done just the same by using the keyboard. To select text simply hold !kbd[Shift] while using any of the above key combinations to move the caret.

## Find and replace

Another common task is to either find a string in a file or replace it. Let's say you have a file with some code you are not so proud of, perhaps all variables are badly named such as "myFunction" and you have decided that it is time to improve this. Fire up the search tool by pressing !kbd[!ctrl+F] and simply type what you are searching for. You can jump to the next occurrence by pressing !kbd[Enter] or the previous by pressing !kbd[Shift+Enter].

> This command also works in your browser and can be used to find text on websites.

If you want to find all occurrences in your whole project, the command is instead !kbd[!ctrl+Shift+F].

In the instance where you don't just want to find but also replace text, the command is instead !kbd[!ctrl+H].

> It is also possible to perform more complex searches and replacements see [the reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-replacing-text?view=vs-2022) for more information.
