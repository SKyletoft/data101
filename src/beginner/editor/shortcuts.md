# Using shortcuts

To give you a taste of what's to come, with VSCode focused, press !kbd[!ctrl+O] and select the folder that you have cloned using Git.

Programming is all about using the keyboard, while the mouse is useful most of the time when using a computer, this is not one of them. Every action that can be done using your mouse can also be done without lifting your fingers from the keyboard.

You may be tempted to click on the screen to move the caret (the vertical line where text appears), save your file or create a new file, and while this works, it is horribly inefficient compared to using shortcuts. In the beginning, you may not notice this but as you go through the semester it will become second nature to you. Below are some common tasks and how to perform them using the keyboard.

> On Macs the !kbd[!win] key is replaced by !kbd[⌘] and is usually used instead of the !kbd[Ctrl] key. This guide tries to match the shortcuts to the OS you have selected but may not alway be 100% accurate.

## Common shortcuts

- !kbd[!ctrl+C] copies selected text
- !kbd[!ctrl+X] cuts the selected text, both removing the text and copying it.
- !kbd[!ctrl+V] pastes the text that you have copied
- !kbd[!ctrl+S] saves the current file
- !kbd[!ctrl+W] closes the current file
- !kbd[!ctrl+Q] exits VSCode
- !kbd[!ctrl+N] Opens a new file

[Task]
What happens if you press !kbd[!ctrl+X] without selecting any text?

[Solution]
The entire line gets cut.
