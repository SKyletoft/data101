# Introduction

Congratulations, You are about to take your first steps into becoming not only a programmer but a computer engineer! This book aims to provide you with the tools you will need during your 5 years at Chalmers when sitting in front of your own or another computer.

This will also try to create a common ground so that assumptions can be made in courses. For example we will teach you how to correctly set up Virtual machines, a tool for running other [operating systems](/glossary.html#operating-system) (OS) isolated on your machine without having to reinstall your own OS, so that courses that you take in the future may assume you have access to other operating systems such as [Windows](/glossary.html#microsoft-windows) or [Linux](/glossary.html#linux).
