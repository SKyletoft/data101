# Introduction

Congratulations, You are about to take your first steps toward becoming not only a programmer but a computer scientist or engineer! This book aims to provide you with the tools and context that you will need during your university years. Especially related to programming and computing.

This material will also try to create a common ground so that assumptions can be made in later courses. For example, we will teach you how to correctly set up Virtual Machines, a tool for running other [operating systems](/glossary.html#operating-system) (OS) isolated on your machine without having to reinstall your day-to-day OS, so that courses that you take in the future may assume you have access to other operating systems such as [Windows](/glossary.html#microsoft-windows) or [Linux](/glossary.html#linux).

## Who is this for?

This book mainly targets those who have just started a programme relating to Computer science and have no, or very little, previous knowledge. This means that we will write using as much easy language as possible.

If your only experience comes from a course or two during _Gymnasiet_ then you should still find much useful information here but may find the steps to be a bit too granular, hopefully, you can look past this!

## Structure

Begin by reading the beginner chapters sequentially. These will prepare you for your real courses and can be deemed essential. We will go through each topic from the bottom up and each sub-chapter is meant to be self-contained, meaning you can take 10 minutes and read a small bit every day. To receive the greatest benefits, these should preferably be completed before study period 1 begins. Once you have read all the beginner chapters you can progress to whichever chapters you are interested in.

Under _studies_ you will find course-specific information, these chapters provide tips & tricks from older students and should generally be looked at just before beginning the course and can be used as a reference during the course.

## The student division

## If you get stuck

While we have tried to be as thorough as possible, there might still be cases we haven't thought about.
