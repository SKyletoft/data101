# Introduction

Congratulations, You are about to take your first steps toward becoming not only a programmer but a computer scientist or engineer! This book aims to provide you with the tools and context that you will need during your university years. Especially related to programming and computing.

This will also try to create a common ground so that assumptions can be made in courses. For example, we will teach you how to correctly set up Virtual Machines, a tool for running other [operating systems](/glossary.html#operating-system) (OS) isolated on your machine without having to reinstall your day-to-day OS, so that courses that you take in the future may assume you have access to other operating systems such as [Windows](/glossary.html#microsoft-windows) or [Linux](/glossary.html#linux).

## Who is this for?

This book mainly targets those who have just started a programme relating to Computer science and have no, or very little, previous knowledge. This means that we will write using as much easy language as possible.

If your only experience comes from a course or two during _Gymnasiet_ then you should still find much useful information here but may find the steps to be a bit too granular, hopefully you can look past this!
