# Contributing

Nice, you have decided that something is missing or should be expanded upon, or perhaps just want to fix a typo. The instructions are written with the expectation that you have at least read chapters 1-4.

## Installation

To set up the development environment, you first fo all need [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) installed. You should then open the book by running `mdbook serve --open`, which will open the web page and dynamically update as you edit it.

## Contributing

To start editing pages you just have to edit the files in the ´src´ directory. The pages are written in Markdown, if you are unfamiliar with it I recommend reading [this](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/markdown.html).

When you are done, you should open a pull request on the Data101 GitHub page and describe what you have changed. You may then receive feedback on your edit if there is something that has to be changed, otherwise it will be merged with the project and reflected in the actual book!

## Things to keep in mind

- If you are adding new pages or writing about new technologies, remember to also add an entry in the glossary and hyperlink to it. Examples of this can bee seen on the introduction page. You should only hyperlink the first instance of the word.
