# Getting started

To begin with, you need to install a couple of applications, these will be useful throughout your education. This section will only quickly describe how to install the software, in the later chapters we will tell you more about why and how we use them.

## Editor: VSCode

VSCode is our recommended editor, this is the application you write code with. [Download it here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Online meetings: Zoom

Sometimes you will have lectures online, the university uses Zoom for this. It is also possible to set up your own room and talk to your group partners remotely. [Download it here.](https://chalmers.zoom.us/)

{{ begin .windows }}

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

**This is only necessary if you use Microsoft Windows.** WSL allows you to run Linux programs. Linux is another operating system that will get to know more about during your studies. The official instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) but they can be a bit complicated. So we have included our own instructions below as well.

Start by running `cmd` or `powershell`. This can be done by pressing !kbd[!win] and searching for `powershell` and then right-clicking on `Windows Powershell` and selecting `Run as administrator`, note that if you have Windows set to Swedish it will be translated.

A new window will open where you can run commands. After typing your command you can run it by pressing `Enter`. Run `wsl --install` and then reboot your computer.

You can now start WSL by searching for `ubuntu` from the Windows Start Menu. Follow the instructions on screen and you are good to go!

## IT-services at Chalmers

### Chalmers ID (CID)

Your CID is used to access all Chalmers services. You will get instructions on how to get one during your first days at Chalmers.

> You will need your CID to use all the services in this section. Feel free to come back once you have it.

### IT-support

Using Chalmers IT-services is never easy but there is some help to be had at the [IT-portal](https://chalmers.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/), though it does not cover everything.

### Wi-fi: Eduroam

Chalmers and GU uses the global university network "Eduroam" for wi-fi connectivity (there is wi-fi everywhere on campus). Search for "Eduroam" on the IT-portal to find out how to connect your devices.

### Online storage

Chalmers provides [OneDrive storage](https://chalmers.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?unid=c8fe18c158004038beccd0a8d57ef1f5) to all students where you can store and share files online.

### Graphical Remote Desktop

Sometimes you need special software or more computer power for a lab. It is almost always possible to use the computers at school but it is also possible to access them remotely from home using Remote desktop software. [Here](https://chalmers.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?unid=304967f9ad004d3293b986a976e39833) you can find out how to connect, depending on your operating system.

### Schedule: TimeEdit

You can find both programme and course schedules on [TimeEdit](https://cloud.timeedit.net/chalmers/web/public/). It is also possible to export the calendar to other calendar programs such as Google Calendar.

## Ladok

Ladok is the national service for managing your courses, exams, etc. This is where you will do your final registration for courses, exams and re-exams. Make sure to keep an eye out for when you have to register. The window for courses is usually from two weeks before the course starts, until the end of the first week of the course. Exam registration is usually open during the second half of the study period. **If you do not register in time, then there is no way register manually by talking to the administration, instead you wil have to wait until next time**.

You can log in at [student.ladok.se](https://student.ladok.se).
